# Prediction of the Production of a Wind Farm

## Project Overview

This project aims to predict the monthly electricity production (in kWh) of a wind farm consisting of 50 wind turbines. By leveraging machine learning, the goal is to move beyond theoretical calculations and use real-world data to predict energy output. The project encompasses data preprocessing, feature engineering, model selection, hyperparameter optimization, and final prediction generation.

## Project Structure

The project is broken down into the following key steps:

1. **Data Import and Visualization**: Importing and visualizing raw data collected from the wind turbines.
2. **Feature Engineering**: Selecting and preparing relevant features (wind speed, direction, etc.) for model training.
3. **Model Selection**: Choosing the most suitable supervised learning algorithms to predict the energy output.
4. **Hyperparameter Optimization**: Using techniques like cross-validation and `GridSearchCV` to optimize model performance.
5. **Prediction Generation**: Using the best model to generate predictions for the wind farm's monthly power production.

## Dataset Description

The dataset contains the following features:

- **Date**: The timestamp of data collection.
- **Power (kW)**: The electricity generated by the wind turbines in kilowatts.
- **Wind Speed (m/s)**: The speed of the wind in meters per second.
- **Wind Direction (°)**: The direction from which the wind is blowing, measured in degrees.

The data used for training and testing the model comes from actual wind turbine operations. You can access the dataset [here](https://dyma-courses-assets.s3.fr-par.scw.cloud/Introduction%20%C3%A0%20la%20data%20science%20avec%20Python/Wind_turbine_data.csv).

## Methodology

### 1. Data Preprocessing
   - **Cleaning**: Removing missing or irrelevant data.
   - **Normalization**: Scaling the data to ensure that all features are within the same range.
   - **Feature Engineering**: Preparing wind-related features (speed, direction) to predict power output.

### 2. Model Selection
   We evaluated the following models to predict the power output:
   - **Lasso Regression**
   - **ElasticNet Regression**
   - **Support Vector Regression (SVR)**

### 3. Hyperparameter Optimization
   - Hyperparameters were optimized using **GridSearchCV** with cross-validation to avoid overfitting.
   - **k-fold cross-validation** was used to evaluate model performance and determine the best hyperparameters.

### 4. Model Evaluation
   The models were evaluated using **R-squared (R²)**, which measures the proportion of variance in the dependent variable that is predictable from the independent variables. The best performing model was chosen based on this metric.

## Key Features

- **Data Visualization**: Various plots were generated to explore correlations between wind speed, direction, and power output.
- **Modeling Pipeline**: The project makes use of **pipelines** for efficient data transformation and model training.
- **Optimized Models**: The best model was selected based on hyperparameter optimization and cross-validation.
